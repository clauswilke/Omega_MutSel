 * conv.txt
   * simulations to demonstrate convergence of omega to dN/dS (Figure 2C)
 * np.txt
   * simulations which use experimental NP amino acid fitness data (Bloom 2014) in combination with NP mutation rates (Bloom 2014) (Figure 3, Tables 1,S1,S2, and Figure S1)
 * yeast.txt
   * simulations which use experimental NP amino acid fitness data (Bloom 2014) in combination with yeast mutation rates (Zhu 2014) (Figure 3, Tables 1,S1,S2, and Figure S1)

 * experimental_data/
  * nucleoprotein_amino_preferences.txt -> This file corresponds exactly to Table S1 of Bloom 2014. Gives amino acid preference/fitness data for each of the 498 positions in NP. Each row is a position, and each column is the amino acid preference (alphabetical)
  * np_codon_eqfreqs.txt
   * Contains codon equilibrium frequencies computed from NP preference data and NP mutation rates. Each row is a position, and values are alphabetical (first column is AAA, second column is AAC, etc.). Generated by scripts/np_scripts/prefs_to_freqs.py .
  * yeast_codon_eqfreqs.txt
   * Contains codon equilibrium frequencies computed from yeast preference data and yeast mutation rates. Each row is a position, and values are alphabetical (first column is AAA, second column is AAC, etc.). Generated by scripts/yeast_scripts/prefs_to_freqs.py .
  * polio_codon_eqfreqs.txt
   * Contains codon equilibrium frequencies computed from polio preference data and polio mutation rates. Each row is a position, and values are alphabetical (first column is AAA, second column is AAC, etc.). Generated by scripts/polio_scripts/prefs_to_freqs.py .

 * np_scripts/
  * prefs_to_freqs.py

   * Template batchfile used by prefs_to_freqs.py to create hyphy_files/globalDNDS_{np/yeast/polio}.bf

 * simulation_scripts/   Scripts in this directory were created to run specifically on The University of Texas at Austin's Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics cluster, "Phylocluster". All files w/ extension ".qsub" are job submission scripts corresponding to a particular python script, such that <xyz>.qsub goes with run_<xyz>.py.
  * sim_nyp.py
   * simulate alignments which use NP amino acid fitness data and either NP, yeast, or polio mutation rates
  * run_nyp.py

   * simulate alignments, infer dN/dS and omega for the "codon bias" and "no codon bias" sets
  * run_convergence.py
   * simulate alignmets, infer dN/dS and omega to demonstrate omega convergence with data sets of increasing size
  * functions_simandinf.py -> contains functions used by scripts in this directory.

 * hyphy_files/        Contains files used in HYPHY inference.
  * globalDNDS_fequal.bf -> hyphy batchfile to infer omega according to GY94 M0 model with Fequal (1/61 for all codons) frequency parameterization. Used to determined omega for nobias.txt, bias.txt, conv.txt .
  * globalDNDS_np.bf
